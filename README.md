## To Do:

[X] Get form validation to pass from table cell to table component for save button validation

[ ] Two-way data binding using a service breaks the paginator/sorting. I can grab a link, but it looks like this is an open issue(s) for angular material tables.

[X] Colors for the connection status

[ ] Intro with instructions and an option to fill with the sample data
